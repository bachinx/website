    <p class="about1">
      AC Milan, formed in 1899, is an Italian football club based in Milan,
      Italy. Represented by the colors red and black "Rossoneri", Milan is one
      of the most decorated clubs in football history. 7 UCLs and 19 league
      titles are just the foundation of what football heritage means to the
      world today.

    <h2 class="title2">What we stand for</h2>

    <p class="about2">
      Untiy, Passion and Love are the virtues Milan plays every game on. These
      emotions fly high especially during derby nights. The "Derby della
      Madonia" is the match played between AC Milan and our rivals Inter Milan.
      The city is divided on nights like these and the roar of the San Siro can
      be heard everywhere. San Siro is the home stadium for Milan and Inter and
      has been around since the 1930s

    <h2 class="title3">Curva Sud</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="about3">
      The Curva Sud "South curve" is the name given to the south end of the San
      Siro and the name of the Ultras fan group of Milan. The curva sud are die
      hard Milan fans who spend every ounce of their time and money towards the
      club and have passion passed down from generations. They are responsible
      for decortating the stadium prior to games and they start the chants.
      Leaders of the Curva Sud have even personally talked to the team after
      tough losses to manifest their ultra support.
